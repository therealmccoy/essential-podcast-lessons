                <p>Podcasts have become very popular in last years, reaching millions of listeners daily.</p>
<p>People listen to their favourite podcasts, while commuting, at office or at home; virtually at every concievable place.</p>
<p>While many podcasts have a transcript available to enable jotting down, important points and note taking; still it is a task figure out what is important and what is not.</p>
<p>Many a times, at the first listening, things are not obvious and it requires listening again, for better comprehension.</p>
<p>What if there is a site, where important lessons from top podacsts are listed; so that once you have finished listening to that podcasts, you can refer to this list and may decide to agree or dis-agree with it, copy it or ignore it, debate or just discard the opinions of the list author.</p>
<p>EPL or Essential Podcast Lessons is this one place.</p>
